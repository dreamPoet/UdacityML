##involves AI & Data science

##5 diff. in AI
1. Intelligent agents have limited resources
2. Computation is local but problems have global constraints
3. Logic is deductive but many problems are not
4. The world is dynamic but knowledge is limited
5. Problem solving, reasoning and learning are complex but explanation and justification are even more complex.


## Characteristics of AI Problems
1. Knowledge often arrives incrementally
2. Problems exhibit recurring  PATTERNS.
3. Problems have multiple levels of granularity.
4. Many problems are computationally intractable.
5. The world is dynamic but knowledge of the world is static
6. The world is open-ended but knowledge is limited.


##AI for dealing uncertainty
1. sensor limits
2. adverstries
3. stochastic environ.
4. laziness
5. ignorance

thinking   to    acting    
optimally   to   like humans    

four kinds:  
* Agents that think optimally - machine learning
* Agents that think like humans - semantic web
* Agents that act optimally - airplane autopilot
* Agents that act like humans - improvisational robots
